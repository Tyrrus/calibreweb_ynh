[![Install calibreweb with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=calibreweb)

> *This package allow you to install calibreweb quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.  
If you don't have YunoHost, please see [here](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to know how to install and enjoy it.*

## Overview
This is an implementation of [Calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) for Yunohost.

Calibre-Web is a web app providing a clean interface for browsing, reading and downloading eBooks using an existing [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) database.

*This software is a fork of [library](https://github.com/mutschler/calibreserver) and licensed under the GPL v3 License.*

Alternatively, you may use [COPS](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/cops_ynh) which also allows access to your Calibre Library, but in read-only mode. 

**Shipped version:** The shipped version 0.6.0, but as the numbering changed in the calibre-web app, it is numbered as 0.96.0 in yunohost


Library will be placed in `/home/yunohost.multimedia/share/eBook` folder except if both :
 - calibreweb is set as a private application
 - calibreweb library is set as a public library

In this case the library will be set in `/home/yunohost.multimedia/[admin]/eBook` folder. Library folder can always be changed manually in the application settings by the administrator.

This app support http authentification.

## Screenshots

## Backup library

By default, backup process will not backup Calibre library ([backup_core_only logic](https://yunohost.org/#/backup_fr)).
You may activate backup of the library with 
```
yunohost app setting calibreweb backup_core_only -v 0
```
By default, removing the app will **never** delete the library.


## Known Limitations

* Partial LDAP support : user existing both in Yunohost and calibreweb can use their Yunohost password to log in, but user existing previously to the application installation will not be duplicated in the database automatically
* Authorization access to library to be done manually after install if Calibre library was already existing, for example :
```
chown -R calibreweb: path/to/library
or
chmod o+rw path/to/library
``` 
* Do not use a Nextcloud folder. It's all right if the folder is an external storage in Nextcloud but not if it's an internal one : Changing the data in the library will cause trouble with the sync
* "Magic link feature is not yet available
* Change to library made outside calibreweb are not automatically updated in calibreweb. It is required to disconnect and reconnect to see the changes
* OPDS is not yet working
